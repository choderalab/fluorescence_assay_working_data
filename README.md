# Fluorescence Inhibitor Assay

This repositiory is dedicated to the experimental raw data and analysis work for the fluorescence inhibitor assay. 

It is organized by Erin Grundy's previous work (2018-2019) and my own work (Erica Goldberger). Further on, it is arranged by first **Year** then **Month** of when the experiment performed.
