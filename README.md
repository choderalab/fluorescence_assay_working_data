# Fluorescence Inhibitor Assay

This repositiory is dedicated to the experimental raw data and analysis work for the fluorescence inhibitor assay.

It is organized by Erin Grundy's(EEG) previous work (2018-2019), then my own work (Erica Goldberger)(EAG). After 2021, Liza Casella and EAG continued the work and organized experiments first by the **Year** and then **Month** of when the experiment performed.

## Each experiment should contain 2 Folders: **(1) Experiment** and **(2) Analysis.**
### Experiment Folder should include:
* Lab Notebook entry of performed experiment (Template SOP found here)
* Raw Data
### Analysis Folder should include:
* Any/All scripts used to analyize raw data (i.e. jupyter notebook)
* resulting figures from Analysis
