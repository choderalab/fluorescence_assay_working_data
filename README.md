# Fluorescence Inhibitor Assay

This repositiory is dedicated to the experimental raw data and analysis work for the fluorescence inhibitor assay.

It is organized by Erin Grundy's(EEG) previous work (2018-2019), then my own work (Erica Goldberger)(EAG). After 2021, Liza Casella and EAG continued the work and organized experiments first by the **Year** and then **Month** of when the experiment performed.

## Each experiment should contain 3 files: **(1) Lab Notebook entry, (2) Experiment Folder, and (3) Analysis Folder.**
### Lab Notebook Entry
* Lab Notebook should be a `.md` entry of the performed experiment (Template SOP found [here](https://github.com/egoldber/fluorescence_assay/tree/main/Markdown%20Lab%20Notebook%20Templates))
### Experiment Folder should include:
* Raw Data
### Analysis Folder should include:
* Any/All scripts used to analyize raw data (i.e. jupyter notebook)
* resulting figures from Analysis
