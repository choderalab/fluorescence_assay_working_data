# Fluorescence Inhibitor Assay

This repositiory is dedicated to the experimental raw data and analysis work for the fluorescence inhibitor assay.

## How this repo is organized
### Generally speaking, each folder is organized by _who performed the work_ and the _Year_ then _Month_ the experiment was performed. 
For Example:
* `2018-2019_EEG` is Erin Grundy's(EEG) work from 2018-2019
*  `2020_EAG` is Erica Goldberger's (EAG) work in 2020
*  `2021_LLC_EAG` is Liza Casella and EAG continued the work

## Each experiment should contain 3 files: **(1) Lab Notebook entry, (2) Experiment Folder, and (3) Analysis Folder.**
### Readme.md is the Lab Notebook Entry
* Lab Notebook should be a `.md` entry of the performed experiment (Template SOP found [here](https://github.com/egoldber/fluorescence_assay/tree/main/Markdown%20Lab%20Notebook%20Templates))
### Experiment Folder should include:
* Raw Data
### Analysis Folder should include:
* Any/All scripts used to analyize raw data (i.e. jupyter notebook)
* resulting figures from Analysis
