# Debugging Timing Test: Multiple Well Assay in Corning 3881 NBS Plate
**Test:** Utilizing Corning 3881 NBS Plate we are going to perform the multiwell timing test. This plate is the same as the Corning 3651 Plate (both 96-well half area, non-binding, a black plate with a clear flat bottom, without lid) but it is HALF the area/not as deep. 
* Theory: Less plastic, less surface area for nonspecific binding
