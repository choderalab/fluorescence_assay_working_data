# Repeat EEG 2019/07/23 EXP: Multiple Well Assay Timing Test with Corning 3651 Plate
* EXP previously completed 20190723; but want to use the "better" plate to show that Corning is better at blocking protein binding than 4titude plate
* Originally, EXP ran originally ~2 hrs. → extending to 4 hrs.

# Experiment
* Ran Experiment with Corning 3651 NBS Plate
* Since the D300e is not entirely integrated into the EVO, I cannot “set it and forget it” and run a Momentum script. The procedure will be performed “by hand.” (Otherwise I would have used the Momentum Script: EEG_timing_test_single_wv_20190411 & E_EEG_timing_test_single_wv_20190411)
* NOTES
  * Plate Type: Corning 2651 NBS Plate (Lot 22113019)
  * Plate Layout: 
       !(https://github.com/choderalab/fluorescence_assay_working_data/blob/main/2020_EAG/09_September/20200916_timing_assay_corning_NBS_4_hrs/image.png_)
  * Equipment Used: Our Infinite, Our EVO, the new D300e, our Centrifuge
    * T8+ Cassette SN: 8474404779 LOT: US15021101 
  * Prior to the beginning experiment, I powercycled the Infinite and ran MAINT_Flush on EVO. 
  * Because I am running this experiment by hand and I am not using a Momentum Script. I need to figure out how Erin did her timing as the Momentum script isn’t specific.
  * ~10 runs took 44 min in total (based off of time stamps from .xml files)
  * Time difference between Timestamp 10 and Time Stamp 11 is 27 min
