# Multiple Well Spectra Assay with p38 and Bos, Bos Iso, Erl, and Gef
**Aim:** We need to re-do part of Figure 3; the current Figure data shows an odd trace for p38/Bos, Bos Iso, Erl, Gef. The purpose of this repeated EXP to clean up the signal. We will do the exact experiment that Erin did on 2015-

# Run Experiment Using 4ti-0234 plate
Since the D300e drivers aren’t set up still, I cannot “set it and forget it” and run a Momentum script. The procedure will be performed “by hand.” (Otherwise I would have used the Momentum Process: EXP_FLU_Spectra and Momentum Experiment: E_EXP_FLU_Spectra)
* Plate Type: 4ti-0234 (Clear UV Plate)
* Plate Layout:
