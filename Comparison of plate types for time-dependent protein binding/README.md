# Comparison of plate types for time-dependent protein binding

This directory contains data for Tecan Infinite M1000PRO 'kinetic' experiments featuring repeated plate reads every 15 min for 4 hours to assess the rate of protein binding for various plate types.

## Manifest
* `Analyze kinetic Infinite M1000PRO experiment.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook to analyze multiple datasets
* `data/` - Tecan Infinite M1000PRO i-Control XML data files for 'kinetic' reads, containing a separate directory for each plate type, and potentially multiple XML files representing different experiments for each plate type
